        <h2>About Water My Plant</h2>
        <p>
          Here at Water My Plant we love plants and we know you do too. We know
          plants often need sunlight and water to grow healthy and blossom. When
          Plants don’t receive the appropriate amount of water it hinders their
          growth. Water aids in the transportation of nutrients for Plants. When
          seeds aren’t present for irrigation to occur water is imperative for
          plants to survive.

          But often times we forget to nourish and feed our Plants like we do
          for ourselves. We understand life can be super busy and things happen.
